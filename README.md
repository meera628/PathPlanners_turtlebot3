## Comparison of Path Planning Algorithms in 2D: A*, RRT* and PRM
This project analyzes the performance of three path planning algorithms—A*, RRT*, and PRM—in navigating a robot through a grid environment with obstacles. The comparison focuses on metrics such as efficiency, smoothness, clearance, and obstacle-handling capabilities.

All project files and the detailed report are available in the astar_planner_turtlebot3 branch of this repository.
